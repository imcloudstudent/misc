# boto3 offers two different styles of API - Resource API (high-level) and
# Client API (low-level). Client API maps directly to the underlying RPC-style
# service operations (put_object, delete_object, etc.). Resource API provides
# an object-oriented abstraction on top (object.delete(), object.put()).
#
# While Resource APIs may help simplify your code and feel more intuitive to
# some, others may prefer the explicitness and control over network calls
# offered by Client APIs. For new AWS customers, we recommend getting started
# with Resource APIs, if available for the service being used. At the time of
# writing they're available for Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon
# SQS, Amazon SNS, AWS IAM, Amazon Glacier, AWS OpsWorks, AWS CloudFormation,
# and Amazon CloudWatch. This sample will show both styles.
#
# First, we'll start with Client API for Amazon S3. Let's instantiate a new
# client object. With no parameters or configuration, boto3 will look for
# access keys in these places:
#
#    1. Environment variables (AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
#    2. Credentials file (~/.aws/credentials or
#         C:\Users\USER_NAME\.aws\credentials)
#    3. AWS IAM role for Amazon EC2 instance
#       (http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html)

# Now the bucket is created, and you'll find it in your list of buckets.
